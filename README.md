# FunctionalAnnotationPredictor

This project is part of the Machine Learning class final project.

It is divided into two diferent models:

  Sequence annotation model: It was trained a convolutional NN model to predict the GO terms based on the sequence. The embeded space values were extrater per sequence.

  Structure annotation model: Based on the embeded space sequence and the structure from alpha fold, a new model was trained using transformers and dense layers.
